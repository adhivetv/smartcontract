# multisigwallet
This smart-contract is a multisignature wallet. It stores a certain number of ERC-20 tokens, and allows it to transfer no more than a fixed amount at a particular time. For example, up to date A, you can transfer no more than X tokens from the wallet, up to date B - no more than Y tokens, etc. Multisignature works in the following way - there are beneficiaries, so an outgoing transaction can be initiated by any of them, but each transaction is not confirmed untill receiving the required number of confirmations from other beneficiaries.
